Hello I am Anj.

My motivation for joining the Open House is to explore a potential career shift. I am currently pursuing my second degree, which focuses on web development and programming, and I have unexpectedly discovered that this is something I am eager to pursue and truly enjoy.

I’m currently working at IBM as an Event Manager and Procurement Specialist for the past nine years. Prior this, I completed an internship at Meralco Ortigas in the Learning and Development department, and then worked as a Training Officer at the Ateneo Center for Organizational Research and Development.
